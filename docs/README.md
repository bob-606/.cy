## Letter of Intent - MBA Program (Open University of Cyprus)

**Dear Admissions Committee,** <br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing an MBA at the Open University of Cyprus. My atypical background and current academic pursuits position me well for advanced business education.

### Educational Background

I hold two bachelor's degrees—Business Administration and Electrical Engineering—providing me with both analytical problem-solving skills and business fundamentals. I recently completed a full-stack developer course in Estonia and am currently pursuing an MSIT at the University of the People, having completed 7 of 12 courses (e.g., business law and organizational behaviour).

### Why Open University of Cyprus

Your program's flexible distance learning format allows me to continue my current MSIT studies while pursuing the MBA. The international perspective and technology integration align perfectly with my career objectives in the digital economy. My plan is to dedicate 75% of my study time to the MBA program and the rest to the MSIT program; to illustrate, 3 MBA subjects and 1 MSIT subject per semester.

### Value I Bring

- Engineering and analytical skills as well as problem-solving expertise
- Solid business foundation and technical proficiency
- Ability to bridge technology and business strategy
- Proven ability to manage multiple academic programs simultaneously

### Conclusion

The MBA at Open University of Cyprus represents the ideal next step in my professional and personal development. My diverse background, combined with your program's comprehensive curriculum, will prepare me for leadership roles in today's technology-driven business environment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, <br>
J.J. Lim
